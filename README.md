Our app is coded on the file named "project.py".
The file named "api_keys.py" contains several API keys in order to exceed the daily limit
Request.py is a file that contains the request function.
The API keys of "api_key.py" are imported into the "request.py" file. The "request.py" file is then imported in the "project.py" file
